#Planning the Mission

By now, you are familiar with DevSecOps so let's parachute-in and get started.  This week will be useful for you if you can very clearly state the goals of your mission and outline the basic path forward.  Everything good begins with a plan, even if it's only on the back of your cocktail napkin.  You cannot be successful without knowing why a DevSecOps change is important to your organization.  And you also cannot succeed if you haven't yet taken stock of where your organization is in their security journey.  

During this week, we'll work on developing our plans for implementing DevSecOps so that we can unite Top-Down and Bottoms-Up efforts before we get too far down the path.  

##Success Criteria
After taking this module, you will be able to successfully plan for DevSecOps changes.  You will be able to elaborate on the mission and present a compelling story of change for your organization.
