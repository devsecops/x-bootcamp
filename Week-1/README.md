#Planning the Mission

By now, you are familiar with DevSecOps so let's parachute-in and get started.  

Everything good begins with a plan, even if it's only on the back of your cocktail napkin.  You cannot be successful without knowing why a DevSecOps change is important.  And you also cannot succeed if you haven't yet taken stock of where your organization is in their security journey.  

During this week, we'll work on developing our plans for implementing DevSecOps so that we can unite Top-Down and Bottoms-Up efforts before we get too far down the path.
